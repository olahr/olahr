- 👋 Hi, I’m Oliver
- 👀 I’m interested in setting up this account to create a portfolio of the code I have written and getting involved in some OpenSource projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning creating a ray tracing application, how to emulate an M6502 processor and writing a compiler in C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IBM Call for Code after investigating node-red on my Ubuntu 64-bit machine. As well, I want to create a portfolio of the code I have 
      written, starting with some simple programs to implementations of the projects I referred to above.
- 📫 I can be reached at olahr@shaw.ca.
